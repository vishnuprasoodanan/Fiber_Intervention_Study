The quantification of core microbiomes typically employs one of three methodologies (Neu et al., 2021):

1.	Assessing the occurrence of microbial taxa across multiple samples from the same host or environment,
2.	Analyzing the relative abundances of microbial taxa within these samples,
3.	A combination of the above-mentioned approaches.

In our study, we established the core microbiome (at the genus level) based on the presence of genera in 25%, 50%, 75%, and 80% of samples within each group. These groups encompassed individuals with a habitual diet (71 samples), those following a high-fiber diet (71 samples), along with 32 mice subjected to Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT). Additionally, the study also included 26 mice samples supplemented with Citrobacter rodentium and subjected to FMT using human-derived samples. Visual representations were employed to illustrate the abundance of the core microbiome within each sample and the average abundance across sample groups. The Supplementary Figure 2B within the manuscript illustrates a sample-wise depiction of the core microbiome, as defined by their presence in 80% and 25% of samples in both humans and FMT-treated mice. Likewise, Supplementary Figure 3E showcases the core microbiome in humans and mice samples supplemented with Citrobacter, followed by FMT. The directory contains the script (Stacked_BarPlot_Genus_Abundance.R) utilized to generate these plots. Additionally, the directory includes Core_Microbiome_Figure1.pdf and Core_Microbiome_Figure2.pdf, illustrating the average abundance of the core microbiome (using 25% and 80% criteria) across each group considered. Moreover, the script (Core_Microbiome_Average_Plot.R) responsible for generating these average plots can be found in this directory.

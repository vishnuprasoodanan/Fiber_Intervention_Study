Core microbiomes are typically quantified using one of three methods: 
1) the occurrence of microbial taxa across multiple samples of the same host/environment, 
2) the relative abundances of microbial taxa across such samples, or 
3) some combination of the two (Neu et al., 2021). 
I tried to define core microbiome (at genus level) based on presence of genera in 25%, 50%, and 80% of samples in each group (i.e., humans-V1, huamns-V3 and mice).
